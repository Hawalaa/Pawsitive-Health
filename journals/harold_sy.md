       Worked as a team with team members

       Today, I worked on:

       getting my part of the migrations in which are for the
       immunization and medical records tables. I tried my best
       to follow the patterns and understand the what and why of
       things.

## Reflection:

        For the FastAPI we create migrations listed from 001 to 999
        to give us more possible entries. We do this because we want
        to create our tables as we write code. The migrations is just
        a regular Python file that is comprised of a list of multiline
        strings.

       Today, I worked on:

       getting the immunization end point up and running. I had some
       issues like using dates instead of strings and I worked through
       it. The other issue that I got stuck on was whether or not we
       needed both user id and pet id. I tried working through it to
       get it working but could not get it to work. I will need to get
       help from the team tomorrow. Also the return shape is not coming
       out correctly and I am getting that annoying server error even
       after I entered in the codes that Curtis was talking about to
       get a better error message.

## Reflection:

        I was trying hard to understand the code but other than the
        SQL, the rest of it was not intuitive. It is like learning a
        new function or method in Python except we are not given an
        explanation of the parameters and what they are used for. From
        My point of view it feels like Curtis is just making things up
        as he goes along and remembering the pieces and what they are
        for is somewhat doable but better with repetition.
