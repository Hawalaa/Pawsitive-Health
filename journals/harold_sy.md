       Today, I worked on:

       getting my part of the migrations in which are for the
       immunization and medical records tables. I tried my best
       to follow the patterns and understand the what and why of
       things.

## Reflection:

        For the FastAPI we create migrations listed from 001 to 999
        to give us more possible entries. We do this because we want
        to create our tables as we write code. The migrations is just
        a regular Python file that is comprised of a list of multiline
        strings.
