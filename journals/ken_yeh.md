### Today I worked on:
Today I worked on the update function on the pet profile page. It was a group effort. I added the PUT and DELETE mutations to my API file and imported into the UpdatePetModal.js file. I had to pass params into my function and used it in my handleSubmit to update the specific pet. I also created initial values in the modal so it shows the current values and use wouldn't have to retype everything. I also completed the delete button to delete the specific pet. I imported the deletePetProfileMutation to my PetProfile.js file and created my handleDelete there. Started working on updating the endpoints wiki on gitlab since it was out-dated.
