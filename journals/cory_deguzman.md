Today, I worked on:

-   Creating the Postgres database
-   Creating the Users and Pet tables in the database

After I finished my tasks, I helped guide my teammates on how to pull the code from the repository and how to run the code on their local machines. After successfully running the code, I helped them create their own tables, push their changes back to remote. We also walked through how to create a pull request and merge it into the master branch.
